Distributed System Challenge

## Prerequisites

Composer - https://getcomposer.org/download/

RabbitMQ server - https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

## Configuration

Configuration is split between the three different components: webserver, producer and consumer.

### Webserver

Open *main.js* located at /webserver/assets/js/ . Notice the following properties and change according to your personal setup.

- **helloprint.PRODUCER_SERVER** - API server location
- **helloprint.PRODUCER_ROOT_PATH** - API server root directory location

### Producer

- Install lib dependencies and generate autoloader through ```composer install``` .
- On .htaccess file, change RewriteBase to match your API server root directory.
- On /producer/src/Configuration.php, set up your database, queue and routing settings as needed.

### Consumer

- Install lib dependencies and generate autoloader through ```composer install``` .
- On /consumer/src/Configuration.php, set up your database and queue settings as needed.
- Configure sendmail service with your email server credentials.

## Usage

### Login and requesting password
Simply access login.html on your webserver root.

### Launching consumer script
To launch the consumer execute the following command on the consumer server root:

```php consumer.php <queue_name> <num_workers>```

where *<queue_name>* is the queue you will be consuming from and *num_workers* is the number of workers you want to launch. The arguments are optional. If no arguments are presented, the script will run the default queue with one worker.

__Attention: Your RabbitMQ service needs to be running on your consumer server.__
